API Test Cases:
- Test service status of the API endpoint (only one in this case)
- Find how many tasks do not have "category" assigned
- Aggregate and print only "task names"
- Read API response and print tasks in descending "due date" order
- Count and validate the number of tasks

Scope of Testing:
- API automation as listed above
- UI automation in latest Chrome (see automation folder)
- Manual testing in Chrome as listed above
- Browsers other than Chrome are not tested
- Performance / Stress testing is not performed
- Testing with other character sets is not performed
- Usability testing is not performed
- Mobile device testing is not performed
- Responsive design is not tested (e.g. different screen sizes)



Defects / Feature Requests:
- Webpage shows error "Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach()" if no tasks are in the list
- Webpage shows error "Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach()" if no categories exist
- Last updated time shows in CET, should show in users timezone
- Due date has 3 dropdowns which may cause confusion.  Calendar control would enhance usability.
- No errors are displayed if user clicks Add without entering text.  Disabling the add button when text field empty would enhance usability.
- No errors are displayed if user clicks Add category without entering text.  Disabling the add button when text field empty would enhance usability.
- JavaScript can be entered as Task or Category, which executes when next user loads it.  This content should be disallowed or encoded to prevent unintended code execution.
